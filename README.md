Please check user class for comments

We have demonstrated the use of different classes 
That handle individual tasks like the song class 
That plays songs and the user class that controls user
Methods. 

We have demonstrated the use of agile throught the 
Meetings we held with goals oriented towards functionality
These have been submitted through worklogs and meeting notes

We used a libray called jaco mp3. Jaco mp3 can be downloaded
And as long as it is in the same folder as it is 
In the github then it runs the song.

To change the song you can change the mp3 file name 
In the song class.
